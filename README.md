Web application that allows the user to choose coordinates, then provides the weather over a week along with some helpful info.

## Description

This website was designed within three days for the College of Staten Island Fall 2021 Hackathon, hosted by the Hack-A-Project Club.  Any updates past the date of 9/5/2021 are post-hackathon event.  

Programmed by: Michael Warmbier<br>
Design: Mahima Karanth<br>
Resource Gathering: Shu Yuan William Lin<br>

'The theme of this event was social issues. As someone who has experienced the effects of Hurricane Sandy, and during a time that many people are being impacted by the constantly changing tides of global warming, I believe this site is the start in the right direction to a free, accessible source of information for these events, as well as general weather info' - Michael
